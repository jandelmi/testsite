I an a Doctoral Candidate in Aalto University School of Science. I am working as a researcher and teach courses on various fields of Mathematical Optimization at the Department of Mathematics and Systems Analysis. My other interest are Computer Science and GPU programming. Specifically, I am interested in combining techniques from Operations Research and Computer Science to develop efficient solution methods. One such example could be the use of decomposition methods in Mixed-Integer Programming, where subproblems could be solved efficiently with Constraint Programming methods. I am also investigating how to exploit GPU computing in Mathematical Optimization problems with suitable structures. 

My previous work includes developing algorithms for Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), especially in the context of Alternative Fuel Vehicles such as Battery Electric Vehicles. I have also been working as a senior consultant in WeOptIt from December 2018 onwards. This page is basically a test to see how easy / difficult it is to create decent looking webpages.
