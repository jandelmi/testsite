I am a Doctoral Candidate in Aalto University School of Science, working as a researcher and teaching courses on various fields of Mathematical Optimization at the Department of Mathematics and Systems Analysis. My other interest are Computer Science and GPU programming. Specifically, I am interested in combining techniques from Operations Research and Computer Science to develop efficient solution methods. Typical example of this could be a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming problem with a structure that decomposes into several smaller subproblems, each of which can be solved in parallel with Constraint Programming methods. In the same vein, I am also investigating how to exploit GPU computing in Mathematical Optimization to solve, for example, the subproblems in the above example. 

My previous work includes developing algorithms (both [exact](https://doi.org/10.1287/trsc.2016.0734) and [heuristic](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2019.04.018)) for Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs), especially in the context of Alternative Fuel Vehicles (e.g., [Electric VRP with Time Windows and Partial Recharges](https://sal.aalto.fi/files/personnel/juho.andelmin/tand14_public.pdf), where fuel consumption and refueling stations are both included in the routing models. I have also studied [Resource Allocation Problems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2020.03.031) where decision makers wish to (re-)allocate input resources among several decision-making units (e.g., supermarkets, restaurants) to maximize outputs (e.g., profit, sales) and/or minimize inputs. The results indicate that relying on traditional efficiency scores from efficiency analysis may lead to suboptimal solutions. 

I have also been working as a senior consultant in [WeOptIt](https://weoptit.com/) since December 2018. I am currently focusing on graduating and expanding my team's latest research related to the [Decision Programming](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.09196.pdf) framework for solving multi-stage decision-making problems under uncertainty.
